# Changelog

## [0.3.0] - 2024-12-19 - CLI-MCP Integration Complete 

### Major Milestone: Full CLI-MCP Pipeline Working

This release marks the completion of the core CLI-MCP integration, creating a fully functional terminal assistant with smart command execution and safety analysis.

### Added
- **Complete CLI Client** (`cli/terminal_client.py`)
  - Interactive terminal session with beautiful Rich UI
  - Single command execution mode with `--force` flag
  - Command safety analysis without execution
  - Command history and help system
  - Progress indicators and status feedback

- **MCP Client Integration** (`cli/mcp_client.py`)
  - Real MCP server communication replacing simulations
  - Async/await architecture for proper MCP handling
  - Error handling and connection management
  - Full integration with all MCP server tools

- **Comprehensive Demo System** (`scripts/demo.py`)
  - Automated testing of command classification
  - Live execution demonstration
  - System information showcase
  - Results table with pass/fail status

- **Enhanced Security Features**
  - User confirmation system for dangerous commands
  - Educational feedback with safety suggestions
  - Force execution option for advanced users
  - Three-tier classification (safe/dangerous/forbidden)

### Changed
- **Architecture**: Moved from simulation to real MCP server calls
- **User Experience**: Implemented the "press y for confirmation" concept
- **Command Flow**: Full pipeline from CLI → MCP Client → MCP Server → System
- **Documentation**: Updated README with current working state and usage examples

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance**: Fixed MCP timeout issues by removing blocking calls
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Code Quality**: Clean async/await patterns throughout
- **Testing**: Real command execution with safety validation

### Demonstrated Capabilities
- ✅ Safe command execution: `pwd`, `whoami`, `date` run immediately
- ✅ Dangerous command detection: `rm file.txt` requires confirmation
- ✅ Safety analysis: Command risk assessment without execution
- ✅ Cross-platform support: Commands adapt to different operating systems
- ✅ Beautiful terminal UI: Rich formatting, panels, progress indicators
- ✅ Interactive sessions: Full conversation flow with history

## [0.2.0] - 2024-12-18 - MCP Server Foundation

### Added
- **MCP Server Implementation** (`mcp_server/mcp_server.py`)
  - Cross-platform command execution with safety validation
  - Four MCP tools: execute_terminal_command, analyze_command_safety, get_system_info, list_allowed_commands
  - System status resource with real-time monitoring
  - Comprehensive security classification system

- **Security System**
  - Three-tier safety classification (safe/dangerous/forbidden)
  - Cross-platform command adaptation (ls → dir on Windows)
  - Input validation and timeout protection
  - Educational feedback and safety suggestions

- **Development Tools**
  - MCP Inspector integration for testing
  - UV package manager setup
  - Official MCP package integration

### Technical Foundation
- Python 3.10+ requirement for official MCP support
