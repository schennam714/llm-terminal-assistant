## [Phase 4B.2] - Terminal Enhancement

### PHASE 4B.2: TERMINAL ENHANCEMENTS - COMPLETE

**Major User Experience Improvements:**
- **Command History Navigation**: Added full readline support with ↑/↓ arrow key navigation
- **Persistent History**: Commands saved to `~/.llm_terminal_history` across sessions (1000 commands max)
- **Tab Auto-Completion**: Intelligent completion for common terminal commands
- **Enhanced Line Editing**: Full emacs-style editing support (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+K, etc.)
- **Terminal State Management**: Proper isolation between Rich output and readline input

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Readline Integration**: Added Python readline module with graceful fallback
- **History File Management**: Automatic loading/saving with atexit handlers
- **Command Completion**: Smart auto-completion for terminal-specific commands
- **Terminal Control**: Proper flushing and state reset to prevent Rich/readline conflicts
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Unix/Linux/macOS with optional Windows support

**Bug Fixes:**

## [Phase 4B.1] - Critical Bug Fixes

### PHASE 4B.1: CRITICAL BUG FIXES - COMPLETE

**Critical Issues Resolved:**
- **Plan Persistence System**: Fixed major bug where execution plans were not saved between sessions
- **Dependency Resolution**: Fixed critical dependency matching issue preventing multi-step execution
- **Command Processing**: Fixed plan command routing to ensure forced planning mode works correctly

**Technical Fixes:**
- **Plan Storage**: Added JSON-based persistence system (`data/execution_plans.json`)
  - Plans now automatically save when created, updated, or cancelled
  - Plans load automatically when A2A server initializes
  - Cross-session plan access now fully functional
- **Dependency Bug**: Fixed dependency index-to-ID conversion issue
  - AI generates dependencies as step indices ("0", "1")
  - System now converts to actual step IDs ("plan_20250606_193037_4_step_1")
  - Multi-step plans now execute all steps instead of failing after step 1
- **Force Planning**: Added `force_planning` parameter to bypass keyword detection
  - `plan "task"` command now always creates multi-step plans regardless of keywords
  - Improved planning mode activation logic

**Impact:**
- **Before**: Plans would fail after first step due to dependency resolution errors
- **After**: Plans execute all steps in correct dependency order
- **Before**: Plans only existed in memory and were lost between sessions
- **After**: Plans persist and are available for rollback across terminal sessions
- **Before**: Simple tasks wouldn't trigger planning mode even with `plan` command
- **After**: `plan` command always forces multi-step planning

**Files Modified:**
- `a2a_server/planner.py`: Added persistence system and dependency resolution fix
- `a2a_server/a2a_server.py`: Added force_planning parameter and persistence integration
- `cli/terminal_client.py`: Updated plan command to use force_planning mode
